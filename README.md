# TicTacToe
Another computer implementation of big 9x9 tic-tac-toe, also known as "ultimate" or "strategic" tic-tac-toe!

Intended to be run from the command line, this program supports several command line arguments:
* noai: for playing over-the-board, as it were
* aionly: the opposite, mostly intended for testing
* lesscalc: make the ai stupider, but speed up computation
* morecalc: make the ai smarter, but slow down computation
